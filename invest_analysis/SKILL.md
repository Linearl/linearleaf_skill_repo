### Phase 1: Sector Selection (Step1 - 赛道筛选)

**Objective**: Use AI's information breadth to identify short-term opportunity sectors based on upcoming events (conferences, policies, seasonal factors).

**Process**:
1. Gather context about current market environment
2. Identify upcoming catalysts (1-2 months outlook based on conferences, policies, seasonal events)
3. Rank 3-5 sectors by importance and certainty
4. Extract core investment thesis (催化逻辑) for each sector
5. Identify 1-2 leading stocks as references per sector

**Output**:

- Directory: `step1/`

**Checkpoints**:
- ✅ Is the catalyst source明确?
- ✅ Are representative leading stocks provided?
- ✅ Is the ranking logic explained?

**Recommended Models**: DeepSeek, Gemini Deep Research, ChatGPT

### Phase 2: Supply Chain Analysis (Step2 - 产业链挖掘)

**Objective**: After identifying target sector, drill down to specific supply chain segments and high-value components (找铲子).

**Process**:
1. Create separate analysis for each sector from Step1
2. Decompose sector into core supply chain components
3. Identify segments with highest value contribution (价值量最高处)
4. Find A-share leaders in each segment
5. Discover "picks and shovels" stocks (铲子股 - universal suppliers)
6. Map competitive landscape and backup candidates

**Output**:
- Documents: `02A~02E_产业链挖掘_{赛道}_YYYYQx.md` (one per sector)
- Stock list: `step2/02_标的清单.yaml` (fields: name, track, code)
- Directory: `step2/`

**Checkpoints**:
- ✅ Does it include key segments/value contribution/picks-and-shovels analysis?
- ✅ Are A-share leaders and backups provided?
- ✅ Is the YAML stock list generated for downstream steps?

### Phase 3: Fundamental Verification (Step3 - 深度去伪/财报验证)

**Objective**: Cross-validate Step2's supply chain assumptions using evidence from financial reports and news events. Identify if assumed relationships actually exist in the market.

**Process**:
1. **Financial Report Cross-Check**: 
   - Review Step3c extracted content for customer/supplier relationships
   - Does Company A (identified as supplier in Step2) mention Company B (identified as customer) in their reports?
   - Are order volumes and cooperation status mentioned?
   - Red flag: Assumed relationship but no mutual mention in reports
2. **News Event Verification**:
   - Check Step4 news for partnership announcements between Step2 companies
   - Validate if supply chain relationships have been publicly announced
   - Identify new partnerships not covered in Step2 analysis
3. **Competitive Threat Assessment**:
   - Are there alternative suppliers or competitors emerging?
   - Has any Step2 company lost market share to new entrants?
   - Identify potential disruption to the assumed supply chain structure
4. **Supply Chain Risk Mapping**:
   - Identify bottleneck positions (single supplier or customer dependency)
   - Assess concentration risk: If key company fails, does entire chain collapse?

**Output**:
- Verification report: `step3.5/report/03.5_供应链验证表.md`
- Fields: Company, Role, Assumed Relationships, Evidence Found, Confidence Level, Risks
- Risk mapping: `step3.5/report/03.5_供应链风险地图.md`

- ✅ Have you identified companies mentioned in Step2 but without actual business relationships?
- ✅ Are bottleneck positions clearly marked?
- ✅ Is the confidence level for each relationship documented?

**Impact on Decision**:
- 🔴 Low confidence supply chain → Reduce investment conviction or wait for clearer validation
- 🟡 Moderate confidence → Proceed but monitor news for relationship confirmation
- 🟢 High confidence → Thesis strengthened, ready for Step4 analysis

### Phase 4: News & Events Analysis (Step4 - 消息与新闻检索)

**Objective**: Discover catalysts and risks through systematic news and event analysis.

#### Step4a: News Search & Collection (新闻搜索 - 自动化)

**Objective**: Automatically search and collect announcements, news, and events from multiple sources.

**Process**:
1. **Timeline Analysis**:
   - Major positive catalyst → Did stock price rise after announcement? If not, red flag
   - Major negative risk → Did stock price fall after announcement? If not, red flag
   - Upcoming catalyst → Is stock price already pricing in expectation?
2. **Conflict Detection**:
   - Stock already rallied 50% but catalyst still 1 month away → Overheating risk
   - Negative news announced but stock price unchanged → Market disagrees, investigate why
   - Gap between news date and stock reaction → Possible delayed impact
3. **Validation Gaps**:
   - Which news items don't match the technical trend?
   - Are there hidden catalysts not captured in news search?
4. **Final News Summary**:
   - List catalysts with timeline and confidence level
   - Highlight conflicts and their implications
   - Recommend: Watch for upcoming catalyst dates, avoid trading before announcements

**Output**:
- Conflict analysis: `step4/analysis/04_新闻技术面冲突分析.md`
- Final news summary: `step4/report/04_汇总_新闻与事件表.md`

**Objective**: Combine fundamental and news analysis with technical analysis to formulate final entry strategy.

#### Step5a: Technical Data Collection & Indicator Calculation (技术数据获取与指标计算 - 自动化)

**Objective**: Automatically collect historical price data and calculate technical indicators.

**Process**:
1. Retrieve recent 120 trading days' price data for all stocks
2. Calculate moving averages: MA20, MA60, MA250
3. Calculate high/low points: 20-day/60-day/250-day high and low
4. Calculate volatility metrics: ATR, daily range, amplitude
5. Organize data into time-indexed format

**Output**:
- Technical data: `step5/raw_data/{代码_名称}_technical_data.csv`

#### Step5b: Trend Analysis & Signal Detection (趋势判断与信号检测 - AI + 人工)

**Objective**: Analyze price trends and identify technical signals aligned with fundamental and news analysis.

**Process**:
1. **Trend Assessment** ⭐:
   - Short-term (20-day): Is price above/below MA20? Momentum direction?
   - Medium-term (60-day): Is price above/below MA60? Established trend?
   - Long-term (250-day): Is price above/below MA250? Overall trend?
   - Trend health: Are MAs in proper order (MA20 > MA60 > MA250 for uptrend)?
2. **Support & Resistance**:
   - Recent support: 20-day low, 60-day low
   - Potential resistance: 20-day high, 60-day high, previous highs
   - Breakout zones: If price breaks 60-day high, where's next resistance?
3. **Volatility & Risk**:
   - Average daily range and amplitude
   - Recent volatility vs historical average (high volatility = risk)
   - Gap risk: Overnight gaps that could stop-loss?
4. **Signal Validation with Fundamentals & News**:
   - Does uptrend align with positive catalysts (Step4)?
   - Does downtrend align with negative risks (Step4)?
   - Conflict detection: Stock rallying but negative news → Be cautious
   - Wait for signals: Is price still waiting for announced catalyst?
5. **AI-Generated Signal Report**:

**Tools** (AI assistance):
- Analysis helper: `step5/tools/step5b_trend_analysis.py` (optional)
- Input: Technical data from Step5a + catalyst timeline from Step4c
- Output: Signal report with recommendations

**Checkpoints**:
- ✅ Have you assessed trends at multiple timeframes?
- ✅ Are support/resistance levels clearly identified?
- ✅ Is technical signal aligned with fundamental analysis?
- ✅ Are conflicts with news catalysts documented?

#### Step5c: Entry Decision & Strategy Formulation (入场决策与策略制定)

**Objective**: Make final investment decision based on integrated analysis (fundamentals + news + technical).

**Process**:
1. **Integrated Assessment**:
   - Step3c: Is business fundamentally sound? (Business Reality Score: 1-10)
   - Step4c: Are catalysts positive and upcoming? (Catalyst Timeline)
   - Step5b: Is technical setup favorable for entry? (Trend & Signal Quality)
   - Step3.5: Is supply chain thesis validated? (Confidence Level)

2. **Decision Matrix**:
   | Business | Catalyst | Technical | Supply Chain | **Action** |
   |----------|----------|-----------|--------------|-----------|
   | Bullish | Positive | Strong Up | High Conf | **BUY** |
   | Bullish | Positive | Neutral | High Conf | **WAIT for Setup** |
   | Bullish | Neutral | Strong Up | High Conf | **Consider BUY** |
   | Bullish | Negative | Strong Down | High Conf | **WAIT** |
   | Neutral | Positive | Strong Up | Mod Conf | **Monitor** |
   | Bearish | Any | Any | Low Conf | **AVOID** |

3. **Price Target & Risk Management**:
   - Entry price range: Where is the best risk/reward ratio?
     - Trend continuation entry: Above/near 20-day high (stronger momentum)
     - Pullback entry: Near 20-day or 60-day support (lower risk)
     - Breakout entry: Above resistance level (requires catalyst confirmation)
   - Support level (Stop Loss): Where would thesis break?
   - Profit targets: Conservative/Base/Aggressive targets based on volatility
   - Position sizing: Based on risk (account % to risk = risk per share × position size)

4. **Final Recommendation**:
   - Clear recommendation: Buy / Hold / Avoid
   - Reasoning: 2-3 key reasons from all analysis layers
   - Timeline: When to enter, when to exit, when to monitor
   - Risk triggers: What would invalidate the thesis?

**Output**:
- Final strategy table: `step5/report/05_汇总_介入策略表.md`
- Fields: Stock, Business Score, Catalyst, Technical Signal, Supply Chain Conf, Recommendation, Entry Range, Support, Target1/2/3, Risk Triggers, Timeline
- Executive summary: `step5/report/05_汇总_最终决策摘要.md`
- Directory: `step5/`

**Checklist Before Decision** ⭐:
- ✅ Have you personally reviewed all analysis? (Don't just rely on AI synthesis)
- ✅ Is the recommendation clear and backed by 2-3 key reasons?
- ✅ Are risk triggers defined (what would change your mind)?
- ✅ Are timeline expectations clear (when to buy, when to sell)?
- ✅ Does entry price make sense given current technical setup?
- ✅ Can you explain your thesis to someone else clearly?

**Implementation Notes**:
- 🎯 **High Conviction**: Business + Catalyst + Technical all aligned → Larger position
- 🟡 **Medium Conviction**: 2 of 3 factors aligned → Normal position
- 🔴 **Low Conviction**: Only 1 factor favorable → Small position or wait
- ⛔ **No Setup**: Thesis broken or factors misaligned → Avoid or close position

### Bonus: Cross-Model Validation (跨模型验证)

**Objective**: Use different AI models to cross-validate findings and avoid single-model bias.

**Process**:
1. Run same analysis through multiple models (DeepSeek, Gemini, ChatGPT)
2. Compare recommendations and identify discrepancies
3. Challenge assumptions and reasoning
4. Identify potential blind spots
5. Synthesize final conclusion

**Best Practice**: Apply cross-model validation at any step (especially Step1 and Step2) for critical decisions.

**When to Apply Cross-Validation**:
- Step1 sector selection: Different models may identify different macro trends
- Step2 supply chain analysis: Different models may emphasize different segments
- Step3c business verification: Ask different models to challenge your conclusions
- Step5c final decision: Get second opinion on entry strategy before committing capital

## Best Practices

### Model Selection Strategy
- **Step1 (Sector Selection)**: DeepSeek (best A-share knowledge) → Gemini Deep Research (validation)
- **Step2 (Supply Chain)**: ChatGPT or Gemini (detailed reasoning) → DeepSeek (A-share specifics)
- **Step3c (Financial Analysis)**: DeepSeek (reports/fundamentals) → ChatGPT (second opinion on risks)
- **Step4b (News Classification)**: Gemini Deep Research (web search + classification)
- **Step5c (Final Decision)**: Use Template 7 with multiple models for self-challenge

### Research Workflow Best Practices
1. **Start Broad, Verify Narrow**: Begin with sector (macro) → supply chain (meso) → companies (micro)
2. **Separate Automation from Judgment**: 
   - Automate: Data collection, extraction, initial classification
   - Human review: Financial interpretation, relationship validation, final decision
3. **Document Everything**: Keep notes on what you found, what changed your mind, what surprised you
4. **Cross-Check Systematically**: 
   - Financial reports vs news (Step3c vs Step4b)
   - News timeline vs technical moves (Step4c)
   - Fundamentals vs technical setup (Step5b vs Step5c)
5. **Question Your Assumptions**:
   - Use Template 7 before every major decision
   - Ask "What would prove me wrong?"
   - Build in a 20% margin of safety

### Risk Management Rules
- **Position Sizing**: Never risk more than 2% of portfolio on single thesis
- **Stop Loss**: Set before entering, not after losing
- **Catalyst Timing**: Know when catalyst should be realized; if not by then, exit
- **Thesis Invalidation**: If any major assumption changes, reconsider position
- **Overheating**: If stock has rallied >30% since your thesis began, reassess entry

### Time Investment Estimates
- **Step1**: 1-2 hours (sector scanning)
- **Step2**: 2-3 hours per sector (supply chain research)
- **Step3a/b**: 30-60 minutes (automatic download & extraction)
- **Step3c**: 3-5 hours per company (manual deep reading)
- **Step3.5**: 1-2 hours per supply chain (validation)
- **Step4a/b**: 1-2 hours per stock (news search & classification)
- **Step4c**: 30 minutes (conflict analysis)
- **Step5a**: 15 minutes (automatic data fetch)
- **Step5b/c**: 1-2 hours (trend analysis + decision)
- **Total for 5-10 stocks**: 20-40 hours (realistic for quality research)
- Always verify information with official sources
- Use AI as a research assistant, not a decision maker
- Understand that past performance doesn't guarantee future results
- Consider your own risk tolerance and investment horizon
